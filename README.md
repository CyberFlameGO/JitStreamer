# JitStreamer
A program to activate JIT across the far reaches of the internet

This program runs on a Linux server and requires the following:
- [rusty_libimobiledevice](https://github.com/jkcoxson/rusty_libimobiledevice)
- (Optional) [JitStreamerSite](https://github.com/jkcoxson/JitStreamerSite)
- A working Rust, Vue and C dev environment

You do not need to build this software yourself, there is a public instance. 
You can find support at the [Jit Streamer Discord server](https://imgur.com/rr9xJhX)
